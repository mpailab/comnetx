Nodes:	89,269  
Edges: 3,394,979  

This network represents loans between members of the peer-to-peer lending network at Prosper.com. The online marketplace allows borrowers to post listings requesting loans. Lenders bid on these listings, which become loans if the amount requested is fully funded by the lenders. The network is directed from lender to borrower. Each edge also contains the time at which the loan originated, the amount requested, the loan status, the credit grade or rating of the borrower, the lender rate and the borrower rate.

### [Wikipedia dynamic (simple)](http://konect.cc/networks/link-dynamic-simplewiki)
Category: Hyperlink network

Nodes:	100,312  
Edges: 1,627,472  

This network shows the evolution of hyperlinks between articles of the Simple English Wikipedia. The nodes represent articles. An edge indicates that a hyperlink was added or removed depending on the edge weight (−1 for removal or +1 for addition).

### [Super User](http://konect.cc/networks/sx-superuser)
Category: Online contact network  
Network format: Unipartite, directed  
Edge type: Unweighted, multiple edges  
Nodes:	194,085  
Edges: 1,443,339  

These are interactions from the StackExchange site "Super User". The network is between users, and directed edges represent three types of interactions: answering a question of another user, commenting on another user's question, and commenting on another user's answer.

### [Friendster](http://konect.cc/networks/friendster)
Category: Hyperlink network

Edge type: Unweighted, no multiple edges  
Nodes: 68,349,466  
Edges: 2,586,147,869  

This is the friendship network of the online social site Friendster. Nodes represent users and a directed edge indicates that the user on the left side has added the user on the right side to his friendship lists. The network is directed as adding a user to ones friendship list does not imply that the added user has marked the other user as a friend, too. As some of the friendships lists are private some information is missing in the network.

### [Twitter (MPI)](http://konect.cc/networks/twitter_mpi)
