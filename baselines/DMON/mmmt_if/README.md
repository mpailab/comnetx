# MMMT-IF: A Challenging Multimodal Multi-Turn Instruction Following Benchmark

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18216](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18216)

We propose a new evaluation set, MMMT-IF, an image based multi-turn Q&A task with added global instructions between questions, constraining the format of the answers. This reveals limitations of large language models for following multiple instructions and is challenging as the models need to first retrieve multiple instructions spread out in the long chat history, and then reason over them to answer image based questions with instruction constraints. All the instructions and constraints are program verifiable, i.e., verifying them is objective.
